Students studying 

Assignment 3  

In this assignment, you're creating a "research repository." This repository will include: 

  

1. Your own code samples. 

2. Code you've found interesting or practiced, with comments explaining them. 

3. Code snippets you find interesting. 

  

Learning Outcome: 

This assignment helps you learn how to analyze design principles that make coding easy to maintain and expand. 

  

Conditions: 

- You should spend around 10 to 12 hours on this assignment. 

- Use course materials and any resources you need. 

- Your work must be your own â€“ it's an individual task. 

- You can ask your facilitator for help, but they can't do the tasks for you. 

  

Instructions: 

- Make a GitHub repository (repo).  

- Put your research and code into the "Code" section of your GitHub repo. 

- You can organize your content into folders. 

- Add comments to your code to explain what's happening. 

- Include a readme to guide us through your thoughts. 

- choose 2 basic design principles, and one from SOLID, STUPID.  

- Submit a zip file of your repo in Canvas, along with any text files or documents that have a link to your GitHub repo. 

  

Why This Is Important: 

- This assignment is fun and helpful for your professional growth. 

- It's a way to gather your research and share it using GitHub, a powerful tool for developers. 

  

Submission Checklist: 

1. Provide a link to your repository. 

2. Include original or found code with comments. 

3. Make sure there are comments throughout the repository. 

  

Rubric: 

 

- The rubric will be used to grade your work. You need at least 50% to pass. 

- You can have a maximum of two attempts. The most you can get on a second attempt is 50%. 

  

Declaration: 

- By submitting, you're confirming your work is original and hasn't been submitted elsewhere. 

- You won't share this assessment with other students. 

  

Total Points: 100 

  

In simple terms, this assignment is about creating a GitHub folder where you put your own code, interesting code you found, and code you're unsure about. You also need to explain your code using comments. This helps you learn about design principles for better coding. Just remember to follow the instructions, create a GitHub repo, and submit it before the deadline! 

 

Note: It's better to focus on a smaller number of code examples and provide thorough explanations and insights about how they relate to the design principles you're exploring.
